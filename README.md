# RESTful-API
Building REST API using Python and Flask. 

## REST Vs RESTful API

**REST** (**RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer) is basically an architectural style of development having some principles...

* It should be stateless

* It should access all the resources from the server using only URI

* It does not have inbuilt encryption

* It does not have session

* It uses one and only one protocol that is HTTP

* For performing CRUD operations, it should use HTTP verbs such as get, post, put and delete

* It should return the result only in the form of JSON or XML, atom, OData etc. (lightweight data )


**RESTFUL** services means it follows all the above principles.

**REST** is an "architectural style" that basically exploits the existing technology and protocols of the Web. 

**RESTful** is typically used to refer to web services implementing such an architecture.
